# ZARODA POS

Multi-industry, multi-tenant Point of Sale platform. See [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md)
for the architecture (module contract, entity model, ERD, offline sync
strategy) and the build roadmap.

## Status

**Phase 0 — Foundation: done and verified end-to-end against a live database.**

- pnpm monorepo (`apps/api` — NestJS core; `apps/backoffice` and
  `apps/terminal-pwa` are not scaffolded yet, planned for Phase 1).
- Prisma schema for the core entity model (`apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`).
- Row-Level Security policies for tenant isolation (`apps/api/prisma/rls.sql`)
  — see that file's comments for the login-bootstrap exception and why it's
  scoped the way it is. **Also see `apps/api/prisma/create-app-role.sql` and
  DESIGN.md §2**: on Neon (and probably other managed Postgres), the default
  owner role has `BYPASSRLS`, which makes every policy here silently do
  nothing unless the app connects as a separate least-privilege role. This
  was caught and fixed by directly verifying "0 rows visible with no tenant
  set" against the live database, not just trusting that queries returned
  plausible-looking results.
- Auth: JWT login + PIN quick-login (shared-terminal cashier switching),
  RBAC guard, global `JwtAuthGuard`/`RolesGuard`. Exercised live: login,
  wrong-password rejection, PIN login (creates a `CashierSession`),
  wrong-PIN rejection.
- Tenant context: `AsyncLocalStorage`-based request scoping +
  `TenantScopedPrismaService.run()`, which sets the RLS session variable
  before every tenant-scoped query.
- `ModuleRegistryService` + `IndustryModuleManifest` — the module contract
  from DESIGN.md §3. No vertical modules registered yet (Phase 1: retail).
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): install, `prisma generate`, typecheck,
  unit tests. E2E tests need a real database and aren't wired into CI yet
  (they do pass locally against the provisioned Neon database).

**Phase 1 — in progress.** Catalog module done and verified live:

- Categories, tax classes, products, and product variants — full CRUD, all
  routed through `TenantScopedPrismaService` (the first real use of the
  Phase 0 tenant-context plumbing for business logic, not just auth).
- RBAC in practice: reads open to any authenticated role (cashiers browse
  the catalog at the point of sale); writes restricted to
  `MANAGER`/`OWNER`. Verified live: a `CASHIER` token gets 200 on reads,
  403 on writes.
- RLS re-verified for the new tables after adding them, the same way as
  Phase 0 (0 rows visible with no tenant set) — including
  `product_variants`, whose policy is an `EXISTS` through `products` rather
  than a direct `organizationId` column.

Still to do in Phase 1: inventory ledger, sales pipeline (cash + M-Pesa STK
push), shifts/X-Z reports, core reporting, terminal PWA.

## Getting started

```
pnpm install
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
```

Then see [apps/api/prisma/README.md](./apps/api/prisma/README.md) for the
full database setup order (migrate → apply RLS → **create the app role** →
seed) — the app-role step is not optional, see the Status section above.

```
pnpm --filter api start:dev
```
